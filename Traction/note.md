- To find the best channel for you â€“ brainstorm strategies for all 19 channels, run cheap tests on the most promising ones in parallel and then focus on optimizing/scaling the best one
- The 50% Rule â€“ spend 50% of your time building and 50% testing traction channels (in parallel) â€“ helps you build the right product (as you get feedback from traction efforts)
